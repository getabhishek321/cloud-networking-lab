Hands-on AWS VPC projects from basics to advanced networking.
# AWS VPC Projects Portfolio

Welcome to my hands-on AWS Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) projects showcase! 
This repository reflects my journey into the world of cloud networking, where each project builds upon the last—from setting up basic VPCs to implementing advanced security, diagnostics, and cross-network communication.

## 🔷 Project Highlights

| No. | Project Title | Key Learnings |
|-----|---------------|----------------|
| 1️⃣ | **Basic VPC Setup** | Creating a VPC from scratch, configuring subnets, route tables, and IGW. |
| 2️⃣ | **Traffic Flow & Security** | Understanding intra-VPC traffic and implementing NACLs & Security Groups. |
| 3️⃣ | **Private Subnets & Routing** | Using NAT Gateway, designing private networks and routing securely. |
| 4️⃣ | **Secure EC2 Architecture** | Launching public & private EC2s, SSH via Bastion Host, enforcing access control. |
| 5️⃣ | **Connectivity Testing** | Verifying traffic flow with ping, traceroute, curl—troubleshooting access. |
| 6️⃣ | **VPC Peering Setup** | Connecting isolated networks securely with VPC Peering and route propagation. |
| 7️⃣ | **Flow Logs & CloudWatch** | Implementing network visibility using VPC Flow Logs and monitoring with CloudWatch. |
